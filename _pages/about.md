### Statement 
I am a mixed media artist who experiments with different techniques to avoid restrictions during the creative process and to evoke a union of sensations. The aim of my work is to create empathy and dialogue based on symbolisms that are presented sometimes with irony and sarcasm, while some other times with frankness and darkness. Making artworks that are rooted in narrative, I investigate the possibility of transformation of human behaviors and beliefs.

As an artist my intention is to push the limits of comfortability. My work is influenced by my personal experiences, my life queries, the human behaviors, and stereotypes. My research is concentrated on posing questions and on inspiring people to find their voice to resist against the inequalities and stereotypes.
