“I had nothing else in my life. This is my life. I don’t have any other secret to share. Everyone is the same. You get what your destiny says for you,” Maria told me. But, do you always end up dealing with your karma? Do you ever really accept it, or you settle yourself on a spurious reality that you formed, in order to comfort your existence?


During her life, Maria chose to not hide her choices from the world. For me, she preferred to be hidden from her desires.  Her story exposed me to a different kind of empathy. I have known Maria all my life. Before knowing her true story, I used to characterize the reasons behind every decision as black and white. She was the one who showed me that there are many shades of grey in between.
