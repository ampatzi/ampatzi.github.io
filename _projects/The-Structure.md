In the Greek culture, patriarchy is a structure and not an event. In the Bible there is a story of Magdalene, who was a whore and in order to get rid of her sins she had to bathe and dry Jesus’ feet with her hair. I decided to present this story by inverting the roles to show the ridiculous role models that religions often promote. I am referring to Bible and Christianity because it is the religion in which I grew with.

The eight phrases which are written inside the letters, are quotes from the Bible. All of them have to do with men’s superiority against women, as well as the presentation of people with different sexual orientations as parasites.
