Modern life is a combination of voyeurism and exhibitionism. People often use social media to expose their internal and external selves. This project poses a question regarding the extent that the quality of life and the self-esteem have been challenged by the power of social media models and the technology revolution.

An installation projection-mapping project on multiple-sized blocks.<br/>
For perspective, the tallest block was around 1.60m.
