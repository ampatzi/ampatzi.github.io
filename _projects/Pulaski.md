With a crowded main street full of joy and noise, in 15 minutes, Pulaski was altered into an abandoned area. I started taking pictures when an annoyed homeless passed by me, asking me why I am losing my time by taking pictures of a dead city. My photographs are the answer to this man. <br/>

I find a deep beauty in the empty places. I get amazed by the stories, the memories that abandoned areas conceal. Pulaski was a place of antithesis for me and this is how I decided to portray it. I could not avoid the feeling of emptiness and the idea of a haunted place. Although subconsciously I was looking for every possible exit or a human presence, I got enchanted by its repellent, strange beauty.  <br/>

The vision and the dream of the citizens to bring their town in life, is riddled by its reality. Pulaski is like putting together a puzzle of its forgotten beauty and its authenticity.
